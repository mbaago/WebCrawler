\section{Structure}
The overall structure of our project is as follows:

A crawler instance crawls around, and enqueues downloaded sites to a queue. The crawler feeds itself with new links extracted from the downloaded sites.

An indexer instance dequeues downloaded sites from the queue, and indexes them, saving the information to an MSSQL database.

A searcher instance allows the user to search in the index.
