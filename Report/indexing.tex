\section{Indexing}
Because we are lazy, we used HtmlAgilityPack (\url{http://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlAgilityPack}), and extracted only paragraphs from the downloaded HTML. Afterwards, we applied the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tokenization.
	\item Normalizaton.
	\item Stop words.
	\item Case folding.
	\item Stemming
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tokenization}
We split the extracted paragraphs on space, and get a collection of strings. From these strings, we remove the following characters: \texttt{. , ?}.

\subsection{Normalizaton}
We do no normalization.

\subsection{Stop words}
Using the list of stop words from \url{http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/danish/stop.txt}, we remove them.

\subsection{Case folding}
We make all the tokens lowercase.

\subsection{Stemming}
We do nothing for now, because danish, but might use \url{http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/danish/stemmer.html}
